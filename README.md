# password-manager-project

WIP.

A password management application created as part of a Python
course. The image, logo.png, was provided by the course. Credentials
added by the user are stored in a local text file. Retrieval of 
credentials is not supported. Users must search the text file
to find the credentials they are looking for.

A default Username/Email can be added by assigning it to the 
constant, DEFAULT_USERNAME.
